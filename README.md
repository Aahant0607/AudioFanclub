# AudioFanclub
## 🔬 Research-Grade Audio Analysis

This repository stands as one of the most complete, modular, and *research-grade audio analysis pipelines* built in Python. It bridges the gap between raw signal processing and advanced statistical modeling.

*Core Capabilities:*
* *📡 Digital Signal Processing:* Advanced FFT, spectral analysis, and noise reduction.
* *🤖 Machine Learning:* Integrated Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for pattern recognition.
* *📉 Statistical Modeling:* Robust voice-distribution extrapolation and smoothing.
* *📐 Dimensionality Reduction:* PCA-based orthogonal decomposition for signal isolation.
